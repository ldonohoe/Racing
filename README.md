# Racing

This is a simple car driving game created using Python and Pygame. The player will spawn on a random tile of road. Traffic will spawn and drive around randomly. Police Cars will also drive randomly and occasionally target a traffic car or the player and chase them down. The Left Shift key can be used for a short boost which recharges over time.
